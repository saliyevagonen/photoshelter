Error Handling test cases

[TC-06] Verify the table data after refresh



[TC-01] Verify that the user can sort the table data by Last Name in ascending order
    Steps:
        Navigate to url http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables
        Click on the "Last Name" column header to sort the table in ascending order.
    Expected Result: Last Names should be sorted in ascending order (e.g., Bach, Conway, Doe, Smith)


TC-02: Verify that the user can sort the table data by First Name in ascending order
    Steps:
        Navigate to url http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables
        Click on the "First Name" column header to sort the table in ascending order.
    Expected Result: First Names should be sorted in ascending order (e.g., Frank, Jason, John, Tim)

[TC-03] Verify that the user can sort the table data by Due Amount in ascending order
    Steps:
        Navigate to url http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/tables
